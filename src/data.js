        question: "How often should I exercise?",
        answer: " For general health, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week, along with strength training on two days. Adjust based on your goals and consult our trainers for personalized recommendations."
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        question: "What time of day is best to work out?",
        answer: "The best time to work out varies based on your preferences and schedule. Morning workouts can boost energy and metabolism, while evenings might enhance strength and performance. Ultimately, consistency matters more than the time. Choose a time that suits you and allows for a regular routine."
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        question: "How long should my workouts be?",
        answer: "Effective workouts can range from 30 to 60 minutes, focusing on intensity and quality. Shorter, high-intensity sessions can yield great results, while longer sessions may allow for more variety. Prioritize consistency and balance to avoid overexertion and burnout."
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "Do I need to warm up before my workouts?",
        answer: "Molestiae quidem ab soluta exercitationem culpa nostrum iusto illum qui non a harum deserunt atque commodi at velit, consequatur quibusdam dignissimos cum labore possimus placeat consectetur nisi cupiditate? Qui totam est omnis dolor nobis quisquam veritatis a!"
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "Should I do strength training, cardio or both?",
        answer: "Yes, warming up is crucial. Spend 5-10 minutes on light cardio and dynamic stretches to increase blood flow, flexibility, and prevent injury. Warming up prepares your body for the main workout and improves overall performance."
    },
    {
        id: 6,
        question: "Should I lift weights for strength training?",
        answer: "Yes, weight lifting is an effective form of strength training. It builds muscle, boosts metabolism, and enhances bone density. However, other resistance exercises like bodyweight moves and resistance bands can also be beneficial. Choose the approach that suits your goals and preferences."
